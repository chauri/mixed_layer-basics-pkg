*nemparam*
scalar(s), any/all of the NEMURO parameters.  See nemuroinputparser.m for a full list of these parameters and their default values.  Any parameter not included explicitly as an input will be assigned the default value according to the 'NEMURO Version 1.f90' set of parameters.

Water column ecosystem with NEMURO biological module
Descrip:
This module runs a full end-to-end ecosystem model.  The lower trophic levels (nutrient cycling, primary production, and lowest-level grazers) are based on the NEMURO model, while upper trophic level interactions are based on the Ecopath model,  The biological state variables include both planktonic and nektonic functional groups; planktonic groups are confined to a specific layer of the water column model, while nektonic groups can freely move (and feed) throughout the water column (for computational purposes this also includes non-water-dwelling predators like birds).
Vars:

Ewein 
Ewe input structure (see ecopathlite.m).References to ngroup below refers to the number of functional groups in this model. 

nekidx
vector of indices corresponding to the groups in the Ewe model that will be nektonic in the water column model (i.e. can feed on the entire water column).

weightfun
function handle to function of the format w = f(z) describing the distribution of profile shape of plankton concentration at time 0.  The values will be normalized to distribute the steady-state biomass throughout the water column appropriately. z represents depth in meters (positive down)

switching
ngroup x 1, switching parameter for each predator. 0 = no switching, < 1 = switches only when prey is very rare, > 1 switches quickly (no units, 0-2)

bioinit
nbz x 11 array, initial biomass values for all NEMURO-derived variables, i.e. PS, PL, ZS, ZL, ZP, NO3, NH4, PON, DON, SiOH4, and Opal. If NaNs are found rather than a value, then the default initial value from the original NEMURO fortran code is used instead.(mol/l)

bioinitz
nbz x 1 array, vector of depth value corresponding to the rows of bioinit (m) 

nemidx
1 x 11 vector, indices of Ewein groups that correspond to each NEMURO-derived variable.  A NaN indicates that there is no functional group corresponding to this variable.

diagnostic
n x 1 cell array of strings, where each string is a regular expression.  Diagnostic fields matching any of these regular expressions will be included in the output file.  Diagnostic fields are of the format axxyy, where a is one of the strings dbdt, primprod, respiration, decomp, nitrify, pred, egestion, excretion, or mortality, ad xx and yy are two-digit indices of the source and sink functional group, respectively.

Nutrient-phytoplankton biological module
Descrip:
This module adds a simple nutrient-phytoplankton model to the mixed_layer model.  The model is based on the NP model described in Sarmiento and Gruber (2008) Chapter 4, where
  
  dP/dt = P * (Vmax * N/(Kn + N) - lambdap)
  dN/dt = P * (-Vmax * N/(Kn + N) + mup * lambdap)

The maximum growth rate Vmax is determined by temperature and light limitation, following Eppley (1972) and Platt and Jasby (1976), respectively.  The half-saturation constant (Kn), loss rate (lambdap), and fraction of remineralization (mup) are provided by the user.

Vars:

n
n x 2 depth profile of initial nutrients, where column 1 gives the depth values (negative down) and column 2 holds the concentrations of nutrients (mmol N m^-3)

p
n x 2 depth profile of phytoplankton, where column 1 gives the depth values (negative down) and column 2 holds the concentrations of phytoplankton (mmol N m^-3)

kn
half-saturation for nutrient uptake by phytoplankton (mmol N m^-3) 

loss
loss rate for phytoplankton (s^-1)

remin
fraction of phytoplankton loss that is remineralized

H1:
Nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton biological module
Decrip:
This module adds a simple nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton model to the mixed_layer model.  The model is based on the NPZ model described in Sarmiento and Gruber (2008) Chapter 4, where

  dZ/dt = Z * (gammaz * g * P/(Kp + P) - lambdaz)
  dP/dt = P * (Vmax * N/(Kn + N) - lambdap - g*Z/(Kp + P))
  dN/dt = P * (-Vmax * N/(Kn + N) + mup * lambdap) +
          Z * muz * ((1 - gammaz) * g * P/(Kp + P) + lambdaz)

The maximum growth rate Vmax is determined by temperature and light limitation, following Eppley (1972) and Platt and Jasby (1976), respectively.  The half-saturation constants (Kn, Kp), loss rates (lambdap, lambdaz), and fractions of remineralization (mup, muz) are provided by the user.

Nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus biological module
Descrip:
This module adds a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus model.  The dynamics for phytoplankton and zooplankton growth are the same as the NPZ model.  Egestion and mortality go to a detritus pool, which is remineralized at a constant rate to the nutrient pool.  Excretion goes directly to the nutrient pool.
